# UFOs
## Project Overview and Analysis:

### Overview and Purpose:
The purpose of the project is to build a tool that will allow our friend Dana, who is a UFO enthusiast and data journalist, to filter a list of previous UFO sightings by Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. This tool will help Dana write a story on the subject for her job, and ultimately help fund the truth of what is behind the UFO sightings.

### Results:
We were able to build a tool that is able to query the data based along 5 previously mentioned categories.

This tool can easily search the data base by one result, such as by state.

But the tool is very helpful because it can filter the data by several subcategories simultaneously.

Summary:
The tool will allow Dana to quickly parse therough the data to indentify trends in UFO sightings. 

One of the drawbacks of the webpage is difficult to search through the comments for key words. This could be useful to identifying trends withing the various UFO sights, especially as you are able to filter by different times of the year or locations.

To improve the tool, I would want to expand the data it is querying and add a function to search for key words within the comments section. I believe each of these would allow the tool to truly spot trends across time and space, thus improving our understanding (and potentially identifying the ultimate cause) behind many of these UFO sightings. The truth is out there, we need to give inquisitive minds such as Dana's the tools to uncover it.
